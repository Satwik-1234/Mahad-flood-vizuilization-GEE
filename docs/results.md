# 📉 Analysis Results: Mahad 2024 Flood

## 1. Spatial Extent
The algorithm successfully identified inundation in the low-lying agricultural zones flanking the Savitri River.
* **Urban Impact**: Encroachment visible near Mahad MIDC boundaries.
* **Agricultural Impact**: Significant inundation in paddy fields downstream of the bridge.

## 2. Temporal Evolution
The time-series analysis (refer to the main README chart) reveals:
1.  **Onset**: Early July (Soil saturation).
2.  **Peak**: Late July (Corresponds with heavy rainfall data).
3.  **Recession**: Early August (Drainage phase).

## 3. Limitations & Uncertainties
* **Urban Bounce**: Double-bounce scattering in built-up areas may mask floodwaters in dense city streets (urban flooding is under-represented).
* **Vegetation**: Emergent crops (paddy) extending *above* the water level may return high backscatter, potentially underestimating the true flood extent.

#Flooded Area (sq.km):22.516480427401834
